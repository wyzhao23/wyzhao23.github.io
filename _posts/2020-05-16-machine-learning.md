## ML-based Matrix Optimization in Massive MIMO

In the downlink of massive MIMO, the transmitter uses precoding technology to reduce interference and improve 
spectrum efficiency. A complex-valued gradient neural network (CVGNN) is proposed to solve the Moore-Penrose 
inverse of the complex matrix in massive MIMO precoding algorithms. Theoretical linear convergence and numerical 
results are provided to corroborate the application of CVGNN in wireless communication senarios.

## Fog Computing in Internet of Vehicles

As the technology of network, wireless transmission and big data computing develops rapidly, the society has 
entered the Information Era. Internet of Vehicles, the important part of the Internet of Things, is the 
inevitable trend of urban traffic in the future. Fog computing emerges as a new technology of distributed 
computing, which is suitable for applications in the Internet of Vehicles. Internet of Vehicles based on 
fog computing can solve the problems of traffic congestion, transportation efficiency and security. In this 
paper, we review the recent work in this topic and analyze the architecture and scenario of fog computing in 
the Internet of Vehicles. Three aspects of applications are proposed in this paper: VANET, big data processing 
and security. At the same time, we discuss the technical details and challenges in these applications. Fog 
computing has excellent processing power in real-time big data and a high mobility environment, which reduces 
the latency of data processing, makes the deployment between vehicles and roadside units more reasonable and 
enhances the security of information interchanged in the Internet of Vehicles. Fog computing devices will become 
an indispensable part of the future construction of Internet of Vehicles.

## Online Review Classifier

Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms contain valuable information, while sifting through them manually tends to 
dismay people because of the huge amount of data. This study implemented a machine learning-based algorithm to classify 
customer reviews. Our classifier extracts Chinese word segmentation and text frequency for feature extraction and 
scoring, and implements the classification with methods of Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machines. Experimental 
results on the Taobao product review sentiment datasets show that our model based on two machine learning algorithms, 
though results in different performances, can provide suggestions on the selection of the identification classifier 
using a trade-off strategy and helps obtain fast and accurate classification on reviews of different categories.
