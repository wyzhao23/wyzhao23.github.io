Hi, I am Wenyuan (Warren), a second year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department 
at [Texas A&M University](https://ece.tamu.edu), advised by Professor [Chao Tian](https://tiangroup.engr.tamu.edu). 
Currently, I am working on the general area of Machine Learning and Information Science where new algorithms are 
proposed dealing with diverse settings.

Before joining TAMU, I obtained my M.S. degree in Communication Theory & Systems at [UC San Diego](https://ece.ucsd.edu), 
where I worked on Dynamic mmWave Networking with Professor [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/index.html). Before that, 
I obtained my B.E. degree in Information Engineering at Southeast University in 2021.

My research interests lie in machine learning, information theory, and communication. Particularly, I am working on 
deep Gaussian processes and generative models.
